**Modern Bazel rules for building OCI container images with advanced performance optimizations**

Supports both **Bzlmod** and **WORKSPACE** setups. For WORKSPACE setup instructions, see the [releases page](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_img/releases).

`rules_img` was originally written by (and receives ongoing support from) <br>

## Features

- 🚀 **High Performance** - Minimizes data transfer and embraces *Build without the Bytes* from source code to container runtime
- 📦 **OCI Compliant** - Builds standard OCI images compatible with any container runtime
- 🔧 **Bazel Native** - No Docker daemon required, fully hermetic builds
- 🌍 **Multi-Platform** - Native cross-platform support through Bazel transitions
- ⚡ **eStargz / SOCI Support** - Lazy pulling optimization for faster container starts (eStargz or [SOCI](docs/soci.md))
- 🗜️ **Cache-efficient layers** - Skip storing layer tarballs in the Bazel remote cache. Layer rules emit a compact [stream representation](docs/compact-stream.md) instead, and the full layer tar is reconstructed on demand only at push/load time
- 🪶 **Smaller layers** - Deduplicates files using hardlinks
- 🎯 **Shallow Base Images** - Avoid downloading layers from huge base images like CUDA
- 🧱 **Bespoke Base Images** - Build your own base from scratch: directory skeleton, users, CA trust stores and shared libraries (see [base images](docs/base-images.md))
- 🏢 **Enterprise Ready** - Remote Build Execution and Content Addressable Storage integration
- ☁️ **Push at Build Time** - Upload layers in parallel straight from the remote execution cluster to the registry; bytes never touch the machine running Bazel

# The compression algorithm to use ("gzip" or "zstd")
common --@rules_img//img/settings:compress=zstd

# Number of parallel compression workers (gzip only)
# "1" uses single-threaded stdlib gzip, "auto" uses compilation mode defaults,
# "nproc" uses all available CPUs, or specify a number (e.g., "4").
# Any number above 1 uses pgzip, which results in slightly larger files,
# but is otherwise fully compatible with the gzip format.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:compression_jobs=auto

# Compression level
# gzip: 0-9, where 0=no compression, 1=fast compression, 9=best compression
# zstd: 1-4, where 1=fast compression, 4=best compressions
# "auto" uses compilation mode defaults (-1 for default, 1 for fastbuild, 9 for opt)

# Falls back to $IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER env var.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper=tweag-credential-helper

# Push image content at build time as a Bazel validation action (mnemonic
# PushImage) for every image_manifest / image_index that has push_specs, and

common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time=enabled

# What the push-at-build-time actions push. "blobs" uploads every image blob (all

# (default) additionally pushes the config and manifest(s)/tags so the whole image
# exists in the registry after the build.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_content=blobs_and_manifests

# Optional staging repository for image blobs. When set, every blob (layers and

# Applies to both push-at-build-time and `bazel run` pushes.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_blob_repository=staging-blobs

# Optional staging repository for manifests, used only by push-at-build-time in
# "blobs_and_manifests" mode. When set, the manifest(s)/index (and the config
# uploaded alongside them) are written to this repository instead of the image's
# real repository. It does not change where layer blobs are mounted from (that is
# push_at_build_time_blob_repository) and does not affect the `bazel run` deploy.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:push_at_build_time_manifest_repository=staging-manifests

# Forbid `img deploy` (image_push / multi_deploy) from uploading layer blob bytes.
# Layers may still be cross-mounted server-side or skipped when already present,
# but an actual upload fails loudly. Use when layer blobs are pushed at build time
# so a deploy that would re-upload them is caught instead of silently succeeding.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:forbid_layer_push=enabled

# Optional OCI distribution gateway endpoints. When set, registry requests made by
# build actions (lazy layer downloads and build-time uploads) are routed through
# the gateway (http://, https://, or unix:<socket>) instead of talking to the
# registry directly. registry_gateway is the shared fallback; the push/pull-specific
# flags take precedence. These set the IMG_REGISTRY_GATEWAY / IMG_REGISTRY_PUSH_GATEWAY
# / IMG_REGISTRY_PULL_GATEWAY environment variables for those actions.

# Talk to registries insecurely: over plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, accepting
# untrusted TLS certificates. The equivalent of crane's --insecure, meant for local
# development registries (k3d, kind, `docker run registry:2`) that don't serve
# HTTPS. Applies to `bazel run` pushes/loads and to the registry-touching build
# actions. Hosts go-containerregistry already treats as local (localhost:PORT,

common --@rules_img//img/settings:insecure=enabled

# [Experimental] Store layers compactly instead of as full tarballs.
# When enabled, layer rules no longer produce the layer tar as a file output, so
# layer blobs are never written to (or fetched from) the Bazel remote cache.
# Each layer is instead represented by a compact stream, and the full layer tar is
# reconstructed on demand at push/load time, only when it is actually needed.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:experimental_compact_layers=enabled

# [Experimental] Inline small files directly into the compact stream instead of
# storing them as separate content-addressed references. Files smaller than this
# size (in bytes) are embedded inline; larger files become CAS references. Set to
# 0 to disable inlining. Only has an effect when compact layers are enabled.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:experimental_compact_layers_inline_threshold=4096

# Path prefix for entries in the layer `mtree` output group. "./" makes every
# entry an unambiguous full-path entry (recommended); "" emits bare tar paths and
# gives directory entries a trailing "/" so they still parse as full-path entries.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:mtree_path_prefix=./

# Comma-separated, ordered list of fields to include in the layer `mtree` output
# group, on a best-effort basis. Supported: type, size, mode, uid, uname, gid,

# to an empty filesystem (synthesizing missing parent directories and applying
# whiteouts) and serializes the resulting tree in a stable, sorted order.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:mtree_layer_layout=tar

# How the image `mtree` output group is laid out. An image `mtree` merges the
# per-layer `mtree` files (in layer order) into one spec.
# "oci_layer_filesystem_applied_changeset" (default) applies the layers as an OCI
# changeset to an empty filesystem, yielding the image's final filesystem view;
# "tar" concatenates the per-layer entries verbatim. The changeset layout needs
# the per-layer files to keep their whiteout markers, so leave mtree_layer_layout
# at "tar" when using it.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:mtree_image_layout=oci_layer_filesystem_applied_changeset

# How org.opencontainers.image.ref.name is set in the docker save index.json.
# "full_reference" (default) writes the full image reference
# (e.g. registry.io/repo:tag). This is what most tools expect: rules_oci,
# skopeo, and containerd all use the full reference to identify images.
# "tag_only" writes just the tag (e.g. "tag"), which is what the OCI image
# spec technically recommends. Use this if you need strict spec compliance, but
# note that tools relying on the full reference to look up images will not find
# them.
common --@rules_img//img/settings:oci_ref_name=full_reference

# A file of extra image-config labels merged into every image's config.json.
# The value is a single-file label (not an inline value): point it at a target
# whose one file lists labels as newline-delimited KEY=VALUE, a JSON object
# ({"key":"value"}), or a JSON array (["key=value"]). These labels are applied
# to every image and are NOT template-expanded; per-target `labels`/`label_files`
# take precedence over the file. Defaults to an empty file (no extra labels).

## Quick Start

### 1. Pull a Base Image

Add a base image to `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
pull = use_repo_rule("@rules_img//img:pull.bzl", "pull")

pull(
    name = "ubuntu",
    digest = "sha256:1e622c5f073b4f6bfad6632f2616c7f59ef256e96fe78bf6a595d1dc4376ac02",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "library/ubuntu",
    tag = "24.04",
)
```

### 2. Package Your App

If you have any `*_binary` target in Bazel (`cc_binary`, `go_binary`, `py_binary`, `java_binary`, `rust_binary`, ...), you can package it into a container image with `image_from_binary`:

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:image.bzl", "image_from_binary")

cc_binary(
    name = "server",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [":server_lib"],
)

image_from_binary(
    name = "image",
    binary = ":server",
    base = "@ubuntu",
)
```

That's it. The image's entrypoint, cmd, env, and working directory are automatically configured from the binary target:

- **entrypoint** is set to the binary's path inside the image
- **cmd** is populated from the binary's `args` attribute
- **env** is populated from the binary's `env` attribute (or `RunEnvironmentInfo` provider)
- **working_dir** is set to the binary's runfiles root (when `include_runfiles = True`)

For multi-platform images, set the `platforms` attribute:

```starlark
image_from_binary(
    name = "image",
    binary = ":server",
    base = "@ubuntu",
    platforms = [
        "//:linux_amd64",
        "//:linux_arm64",
    ],
)
```

### 3. Push to a Registry

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push")

image_push(
    name = "push",
    image = ":image",
    registry = "ghcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/app",
    tag = "latest",
)
```

Run with:
```bash
bazel run //:push
```

### 4. Load into a Local Daemon

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:load.bzl", "image_load")

image_load(
    name = "load",
    image = ":image",
    registry = "ghcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/app",
    tag = "latest",
)
```

Run with:
```bash
bazel run //:load
```

`image_load` takes the same `registry` / `repository` / `tag` split as
`image_push`, so the same image is easy to push to a registry later. A single
fully-qualified `tag` (with no `registry`/`repository`) also works for
`rules_oci` compatibility. Either way the name is used exactly as written:
nothing is prepended to it and no `library/` namespace is inserted (see
[Image names](/docs/load.md#image-names)).

### Composing Images from Layers

For more control over the image contents, you can compose images from individual layers using `image_layer` and `image_manifest`:

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:layer.bzl", "image_layer")
load("@rules_img//img:image.bzl", "image_manifest")

# Create a layer from files...
image_layer(
    name = "app_layer",
    srcs = {
        "/app/bin/server": "//cmd/server",
        "/app/config": "//configs:prod",
    },
    compress = "zstd",  # Use zstd compression (optional, uses global default otherwise)
)

# ... and a second layer (add as many as you need)
image_layer(
    name = "data_layer",
    srcs = {"/data/logo.png": "@static_assets//:logo.png"},
)

# Build a container image:
# This will contain all layers from base (if set) and the layers given in "layers" (in the specified order).
# Try to put frequently changing layers last for better performance.
image_manifest(
    name = "app_image",
    base = "@ubuntu", # Optional: build "from scratch" without base.
    layers = [
        ":data_layer",
        ":app_layer",
    ],
    config_fragment = "config.json",  # Optional image configuration, uses sane defaults.
)
```

### Multi-Platform Images

If you're using `image_from_binary`, just pass the `platforms` attribute (see [step 2](#2-package-your-app)).

When composing images from layers with `image_manifest`, use `image_index` with the builtin transitions feature:

```starlark
load("@rules_img//img:image.bzl", "image_manifest", "image_index")

# Create platform-specific images
image_manifest(
    name = "app",
    layers = [":app_layer"],
)

# Combine into multi-platform index
image_index(
    name = "multiarch_app",
    manifests = [":app"],
    platforms = [
        "//:linux_amd64",
        "//:linux_arm64",
    ],
)
```

For more details on working with platforms, architecture variants, and building images for macOS Docker daemons, see the [Platforms Guide](docs/platforms.md).

### Registry Authentication

`rules_img` uses a multi-keychain approach to authenticate with container registries. When pushing or pulling images, each keychain is tried in order until one provides credentials for the target registry:

| Priority | Keychain | Registries | Credential Source |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Bazel credential helper** | Any | `--@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper_oci_registry` or `credential_helper`; `IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER_OCI_REGISTRY` or `IMG_CREDENTIAL_HELPER` env var |
| 2 | **Host-scoped environment credentials** | One normalized registry host | `IMG_REGISTRY_AUTH_HOST` with username/password or a bearer token. For injected secrets only — see [Authenticating Build Actions](docs/authenticating-build-actions.md#buildbuddy-inject-short-lived-credentials). |
| 3 | **Inline Docker config** | Any | `IMG_DOCKER_CONFIG_INLINE` env var (the JSON contents of a `config.json`). For injected secrets only — see [Authenticating Build Actions](docs/authenticating-build-actions.md#4-inline-docker-config-from-an-injected-environment-variable). |
| 4 | **Docker / Podman config** | Any | `~/.docker/config.json`, `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json`, `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` |
| 5 | **Google** | `gcr.io`, `*.pkg.dev` | [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) (workload identity, `gcloud auth login`, service account keys) |
| 6 | **Amazon ECR** | `*.dkr.ecr.*.amazonaws.com` | Ambient AWS credentials (env vars, `~/.aws/`, EC2/ECS instance roles). See [ECR credential helper docs](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper#usage). |

The first keychain that returns credentials wins — subsequent keychains are not consulted.

#### Setting up Credentials

**Docker / Podman** (works for any registry):

```bash
# Docker Hub
docker login

# Private registries
docker login ghcr.io
docker login registry.example.com

# Podman (stores in ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json)
podman login registry.example.com
```

**Google Cloud** (gcr.io, Artifact Registry):

```bash
# Local development
gcloud auth application-default login

# CI / GKE — workload identity is used automatically, no setup required.
```

**Amazon ECR**:

```bash
# Local development — authenticate via AWS CLI
aws configure
# or
aws sso login

# CI / ECS / EC2 — instance roles and IRSA are used automatically, no setup required.
```

**Bazel credential helper** (any registry, highest priority):

```bash
# In .bazelrc
common --@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper=my-credential-helper

# Or scope it to registry operations only, so it does not affect the remote cache:
common --@rules_img//img/settings:credential_helper_oci_registry=my-credential-helper
```

This uses the same credential helper protocol as Bazel itself. See the [Bazel credential helper spec](https://github.com/bazelbuild/proposals/blob/main/designs/2022-06-07-bazel-credential-helpers.md) for details, and [docs/credential-helpers.md](docs/credential-helpers.md) for how to scope a helper to the registry or the remote cache with the `credential_helper_oci_registry` / `credential_helper_remote_cache` settings.

#### Bazel Sandbox and Authentication

When Bazel runs actions in a sandbox, it may hide certain environment information like the current username and home directory. This can prevent `rules_img` from finding your Docker credential files.

If you encounter authentication failures, explicitly configure the path to your Docker configuration file:

```bash
# In your .bazelrc or on the command line
common --@rules_img//img/settings:docker_config_path=/home/username/.docker/config.json
```

Replace `/home/username/` with your actual home directory path. This setting affects build-time blob downloads, push, load, and multi-deploy operations.

Additionally, the `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable is inherited from your shell environment for push, load, and multi-deploy operations:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONFIG=/path/to/docker/config/dir
bazel run //:push_image
```

#### Debugging

Set `IMG_AUTH_DEBUG=1` to see which keychains are tried and which one provides credentials:

```
IMG_AUTH_DEBUG: keychain "registry environment" for ghcr.io: no credentials, trying next
IMG_AUTH_DEBUG: keychain "docker config" for ghcr.io: no credentials, trying next
IMG_AUTH_DEBUG: keychain "google" for ghcr.io: no credentials, trying next
IMG_AUTH_DEBUG: keychain "amazon ecr" for ghcr.io: no credentials, trying next
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing authentication issues:

1. **Enable debug logging**: Set `IMG_AUTH_DEBUG=1` to see which keychains are being consulted
2. **Verify credentials exist**: Check that `~/.docker/config.json` or `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` contains the registry
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure the credential file is readable by the user running Bazel
4. **Test with Docker/Podman**: If `docker pull` or `podman pull` works, `rules_img` should work too
5. **Bazel sandbox issues**: If authentication works outside Bazel but fails during builds, try setting `--@rules_img//img/settings:docker_config_path` to your Docker config file path

### Language-specific examples

Any language that produces a `*_binary` target can be packaged with `image_from_binary`. These examples show both the simple `image_from_binary` approach and more advanced layer composition:

* [C++](/e2e/cc/)
* [Go](/e2e/go/)
* [JS / TS](/e2e/js/)
* [Python](/e2e/python/)
* [Custom Distroless base image](/e2e/generic/custom_distroless_base_image/)

## Comparison with rules_oci

Both `rules_img` and `rules_oci` are modern Bazel rulesets for building OCI container images. While they share the goal of hermetic, reproducible container builds, they take fundamentally different architectural approaches.
`rules_oci` uses the [oci image layout][oci-image-layout] as an on-disk representation of container images at every step (base image pull, `oci_image` rule, `oci_image_index` rule).
Additionally, `rules_oci` chooses to use only off-the-shelf, pre-built tools for assembling images.
`rules_img` chooses to use providers that contain just enough information as needed for subsequent steps. We also use customized tools, instead of prebuilt ones.
This results in a more complex implementation, but also allows for interesting optimizations.

## Key Differences Explained

### Shallow Base Image Pulling

Unlike rules_oci which downloads all layers of a base image, rules_img uses a "shallow pull" approach. When you reference a base image like CUDA (which can be 10+ GB), rules_img only downloads the manifest and config - not the actual layer blobs. The layers are only downloaded when and if they're needed during push operations.

This results in:
- **Faster builds** - No waiting for large base image downloads
- **Reduced bandwidth** - Only download what you actually use
- **True Build-without-the-bytes** - Other rulesets download base layers to your local machine in a repository rule. This step cannot be remotely executed and is repeated on every machine running Bazel.

Example with a large CUDA base image:
```starlark
# This won't download the 10GB of CUDA layers!
pull(
    name = "cuda",
    digest = "sha256:...",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "nvidia/cuda",
)
```

### Single Action Layers

rules_img produces both the layer blob and its metadata in a single Bazel action. This design has several advantages:

- **Remote execution friendly** - Single action works better with RBE
- **Image Manifest only depends on metadata** - In rules_oci, image actions depend on the actual blobs of their base image and layers, which must be available during the manifest writing action.

The metadata includes the layer's digest, size, and diff ID, all computed during layer creation.

### Layer Optimization

When writing a tar layer, rules_img uses hardlinks to deduplicate identical files.
This allows for smaller container images.

### Advanced Push Strategies

rules_img offers four sophisticated push strategies compared to rules_oci's traditional approach. These strategies enable:
- **Faster CI/CD** - Avoid unnecesary file transfer
- **Build without the bytes** - Never materialize container layers on your local machine
- **Scalability** - Designed for organizations with thousands of builds per day

| Strategy | Description | Use Case | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| [`eager`](docs/push-strategies.md#eager-push) | Traditional push, download all blobs to the machine running Bazel, then uploads all blobs. | Simple deployments | Normal container registry |
| [`lazy`](docs/push-strategies.md#lazy-push) | Checks registry first, skips existing blobs and streams missing blobs from Bazel's remote cache | Faster CI/CD and Build without the Bytes | Bazel remote cache |
| [`cas_registry`](docs/push-strategies.md#cas-registry-push) | Uses special container registry that is directly connected to Bazel's remote cache | Fast development cycles. | Special container registry (`cmd/registry`), Bazel remote cache |
| [`bes`](docs/push-strategies.md#bes-push) | Image push happens as side-effect of BES upload. Requires self-hosted BES server. | Extremely fast and efficient for large organizations. | Special BES backend (`cmd/bes`), Bazel remote cache |

See the [Push Strategies Guide](docs/push-strategies.md) for detailed information about each strategy.

You can also [**push at build time**](docs/push-strategies.md#push-at-build-time): layers upload in parallel directly from the remote execution cluster to the registry, so the bytes never touch the machine running Bazel. Build actions then need registry access — see [Authenticating Build Actions](docs/authenticating-build-actions.md).

### eStargz Lazy Pulling

rules_img has first-class support for eStargz (enhanced stargz), enabling "lazy pulling" at container runtime. This means:

- **Instant container starts** - Containers can start before all layers download
- **Bandwidth savings** - Only accessed files are downloaded
- **Seekable layers** - Random access to files within compressed layers

Combined with containerd's stargz-snapshotter, this can reduce container startup time from minutes to seconds for large images.

```starlark
image_layer(
    name = "optimized_layer",
    srcs = {...},
    estargz = "enabled",  # Enable seekable compression
)
```

The same setting can be globally enabled using `--@rules_img//img/settings:estargz=enabled`.
Read the [stargz-snapshotter documentation][stargz-snapshotter] for more information.

As an alternative, rules_img can emit a [SOCI Index Manifest v2](docs/soci.md) for lazy
pulling with the [soci-snapshotter][soci-snapshotter] — enable
`--@rules_img//img/settings:soci=enabled` (or the per-layer / per-manifest `soci`
attribute) and wrap the image in an `image_index`. See the [SOCI guide](docs/soci.md).

### Incremental Loading

rules_img loads images incrementally and efficiently by directly interfacing with the containerd API. This provides significant performance advantages over traditional approaches:

- **Direct containerd integration** - When Docker is configured with containerd storage, rules_img bypasses `docker load` entirely
- **Incremental blob loading** - Only new or changed layers are loaded, existing blobs are skipped
- **Streaming architecture** - No temporary tar files or buffering entire images in memory
- **Platform selection** - Load only the platforms you need from multi-platform images

The performance difference is dramatic, especially for large images:

```bash
# Load only the platform you need
bazel run //my:image_load -- --platform linux/amd64

# Incremental loading: only new layers are transferred
# Second load of a slightly modified image is near-instant
bazel run //my:image_load  # Only changed layers loaded!
```

When Docker doesn't support containerd storage, rules_img automatically falls back to `docker load` with a clear warning about the performance impact.

This is particularly powerful in development workflows where you're iterating on application layers while keeping large base images (like CUDA) unchanged - subsequent loads only transfer your small application layers.

**Future Docker Support**: Docker is planning to expose its contentstore API in version 29.0.0, which will enable native incremental loading ([moby/moby#44369](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44369)). Once this ships, rules_img will adopt it to provide incremental loading performance even when the containerd socket isn't directly accesible by users. This will bring the same efficiency benefits to all Docker users, regardless of their platform or configuration.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **Sushain Cherivirala** from Stripe for the inspiring BazelCon talk ["Building 1300 Container Images in 4 Minutes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-yvIQooOSA). This talk introduced the groundbreaking idea of using the Build Event Service (BES) to sync container images between the remote cache and registry as a side effect. While their implementation was based on the now-archived rules_docker and was never published, it laid the conceptual foundation for pushing images as a side effect of the build in rules_img — either directly from remote-execution actions ([push at build time](docs/push-strategies.md#push-at-build-time)) or via a custom build-event-stream listener (the [BES push strategy](docs/push-strategies.md#bes-push)). Their work demonstrated how to achieve dramatic performance improvements in container image builds at scale, inspiring many of the optimizations in rules_img.
