Pushes container images to a registry.

This rule creates an executable target that uploads OCI images to container registries.
It supports multiple push strategies optimized for different use cases, from simple
uploads to advanced content-addressable storage integration.

Key features:
- **Multiple push strategies**: Choose between eager, lazy, CAS-based, or BES-integrated pushing
- **Template expansion**: Dynamic registry, repository, and tag values using build settings
- **Stamping support**: Include build information in image tags
- **Incremental uploads**: Skip blobs that already exist in the registry

The rule produces an executable that can be run with `bazel run`.

Example:

```python
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push")

# Simple push to Docker Hub
image_push(
    name = "push_app",
    image = ":my_app",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "myorg/myapp",
    tag = "latest",
)

# Push multi-platform image with multiple tags
image_push(
    name = "push_multiarch",
    image = ":my_app_index",  # References an image_index
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/my-app",
    tag_list = ["latest", "v1.0.0"],
)

# Dynamic push with build settings
image_push(
    name = "push_dynamic",
    image = ":my_app",
    registry = "{{.REGISTRY}}",
    repository = "{{.PROJECT}}/my-app",
    tag = "{{.VERSION}}",
    build_settings = {
        "REGISTRY": "//settings:registry",
        "PROJECT": "//settings:project",
        "VERSION": "//settings:version",
    },
)

# Push with stamping for unique tags
image_push(
    name = "push_stamped",
    image = ":my_app",
    registry = "index.docker.io",
    repository = "myorg/myapp",
    tag = "latest-{{.BUILD_TIMESTAMP}}",
    stamp = "force",
)

# Digest-only push (no tag)
image_push(
    name = "push_by_digest",
    image = ":my_app",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/my-app",
    # No tag specified - will push by digest only
)

# Push using a destination file (instead of registry/repository attributes)
image_push(
    name = "push_from_file",
    image = ":my_app",
    destination_file = ":push_destination.txt",
    tag = "latest",
)
```

Push strategies:
- **`eager`**: Materializes all layers next to push binary. Simple, correct, but may be inefficient.
- **`lazy`**: Layers are not stored locally. Missing layers are streamed from Bazel's remote cache.
- **`cas_registry`**: Uses content-addressable storage for extreme efficiency. Requires
  CAS-enabled infrastructure.
- **`bes`**: Image is pushed as side-effect of Build Event Stream upload. No "bazel run" command needed.
  Requires Build Event Service integration.

See [push strategies documentation](/docs/push-strategies.md) for detailed comparisons.

Push at build time:

When the `push_at_build_time` setting is enabled, an `image_push` target also
uploads its image content to the registry *during the build* (as `PushImage`
validation actions), so the image is present without a separate `bazel run`. See
[push at build time](/docs/push-strategies.md#push-at-build-time).

Runtime usage:
```bash
# Push to registry
bazel run //path/to:push_app

# The push command will output the image digest
```

Defines push configuration for container images without referencing a specific image.

This rule captures registry, repository, tag, and strategy settings that can be
attached to `image_manifest` or `image_index` targets via their `push_specs`
attribute. Template strings using Go template syntax (`{{.VAR}}`) are accepted
but not expanded — expansion happens when the deployment is consumed by the
image rule.
Note that the template strings `{{.image_target_package}}` and `{{.image_target_name}}` are especially useful here.

This enables an inverted dependency pattern: instead of `image_push` depending
on the image, the image itself carries its deployment configuration, making it
directly usable with `multi_deploy`.

Example:

```python
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push_spec")

image_push_spec(
    name = "push_config",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/{{.image_target_package}}/{{.image_target_name}}",
    tag = "{{.VERSION}}",
    build_settings = {
        "VERSION": "//settings:version",
    },
    stamp = "force",
)

# Attach to an image:
image_manifest(
    name = "my_app_a",
    base = "@distroless_cc",
    layers = [":app_layer"],
    push_specs = [":push_config"],
)

# Attach to another image:
image_manifest(
    name = "my_app_b",
    base = "@distroless_cc",
    layers = [":app_layer"],
    push_specs = [":push_config"],
)

# Now usable directly in multi_deploy:
multi_deploy(
    name = "deploy",
    operations = [
        ":my_app_a",
        ":my_app_b",
    ],
)
```
